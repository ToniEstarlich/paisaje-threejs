# Three.js Practice Lab

This repository contains a **3D scene built with Three.js** as a learning project.  
The goal of this project is to practice **3D graphics, animations, and modular JavaScript development** using modern web tools.

## Features

- Interactive 3D scene with **trees, mountains, and birds**.  
- **Tree sway animation** to simulate wind.  
- **Flying birds** and rotating mountains.  
- **Lighting and shadows** for realistic effects.  
- **Camera controls** with OrbitControls.  
- Modular code structure using ES6 modules.  
- Built with **Vite** for modern development workflow.
